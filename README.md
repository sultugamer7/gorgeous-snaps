Bachelor of Computer Science - Semester 6th - College Project

Developed Gorgeous Snaps - a Photo Sharing Community Web Application like Instagram, using PHP and JavaScript for my college's semester 6th project. Added an explore section where users can see the most liked, most commented and recent posts. It also has a nice admin dashboard with visualized data about users, posts, likes, comments, etc by using CanvasJS. Plus there's also a private messaging section with real time messaging by using AJAX. And a real time notification system too.
